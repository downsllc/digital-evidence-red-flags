# Digital Evidence Red Flags

This repository documents **common red flags** that may indicate digital evidence has been altered, compromised, or is unreliable.

These indicators are intended for **preliminary review** and awareness — not as definitive conclusions.

---

## 🚩 General Red Flags
- Missing original source files
- Screenshots instead of raw data
- Re-exported media with stripped metadata
- Inconsistent timestamps across files
- Files transferred through multiple platforms without documentation

---

## 💻 Device & Account Evidence
- Evidence collected after password resets
- Devices accessed post-incident without logging
- Cloud accounts lacking access logs
- Inconsistent IP or device fingerprints
- Evidence provided without ownership verification

---

## 🔊 Audio & Video Indicators
- Metadata inconsistent with claimed device
- Abrupt waveform or frame transitions
- Repeated background noise patterns
- Compression artifacts inconsistent with native recording
- Files that fail hash consistency checks after transfer

---

## 🧠 Behavioral & Contextual Indicators
- Evidence appears only after disputes escalate
- Selective or partial disclosures
- Timeline gaps without explanation
- Overly curated evidence sets
- Resistance to providing originals

---

## ⚖️ Important Context
No single indicator confirms manipulation or wrongdoing.  
Findings must be evaluated **collectively**, documented neutrally, and validated through proper forensic analysis.
